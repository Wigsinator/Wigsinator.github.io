My name is William Hirsch. I'm a student at the University of Toronto Mississauga, studying Computer Science. I was born and raised in Montreal, and I'm currently 21 years old.

I've always been fascinated by technology, tinkering with it, playing with the settings, saying "I wonder what this does?" This eventually led to me discovering programming in the 9th grade, learning some basic Python 3, and I discovered the joy of automation. It was always satisfying to make the computer do the work for me, even if the process of automating the task took longer than if I just did it myself.

Over time, I saw deeper into it, understanding that programming wasn't just about simple automation, and had some incredibly powerful capabilities. I looked at game development, and at artificial intelligence, and realized that I could make that.

My website is still under construction, the french side especially so. The projects page will have more content added over time.
