My name is William Hirsch. I'm a mid-20s software developer working in Montreal. I got my HBSc in Computer Science from the University of Toronto. I have a wide variety of interests, including politics, philosophy, anime, board games, and video games, all of which tend to find themselves connecting in interesting ways. 

I've always been fascinated by technology, tinkering with it, playing with the settings, saying "I wonder what this does?" This eventually led to me discovering programming in the 9th grade, learning some basic Python 3, and I discovered the joy of automation. It was always satisfying to make the computer do the work for me, even if the process of automating the task took longer than if I just did it myself.

This website exists to act as something of a catalogue for my various thoughts, as well as holding a list of projects I'm proud of.
