A cookbook app that connects to a Firebase Database.
<!--more-->

Pocket Chef is an Android App that allows a user to make recipes and access those recipes. It saves the recipes in a Firebase Database and can then retrieve them from it as well. It also includes functionality to "publish" recipes, but we ran out of time to retrieve those published recipes.  
This project is one I made along with five teammates for CSC301: Introduction to Software Engineering. We were given great liberty to make almost anything we wanted, so long as it met the requisite complexity. We started from square one and had to learn to use Firebase and how to develop for Android. We frankly bit off more than we could chew at first and had to downsize a number of elements that we had wanted to include.
