<h2>CSC290 blog posts</h2>

<p>As part of CSC290: Communication for Computer Scientists, we were required to maintain a blog for the duration of the class. The blog posts are being kept here for posterity, but no new ones are being created as of right now.</p>

<ul>
	{% for post in site.posts %}
		<li>
			<a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }} - {{ post.date | date_to_string }}</a>
		</li>
	{% endfor %}
</ul>
